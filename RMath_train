Assume the proposition B3:\"琳达是同谋\" is false. Then the proposition B1:\"玛丽是凶手\" and B2:\"玛丽是同谋\" are true.\n Twenty-first, check whether the propositions in B are contradictory. We can see that \'B1:\"玛丽是凶手\" is true.\' and \'B2:\"玛丽是同谋\" is true.\' are contradictory. So the assumption of set B in the twentieth step is invalid.\n Twenty-second, all combinations of true and false for the propositions in the set B are traversed. So the assumption of set C in the twelfth step is invalid.\n Twenty-third, make new assumption for set C. Assume the proposition C3:\"莉莉是毫不知情者\" is true. Then the proposition C1:\"玛丽是毫不知情者\" and C2:\"琳达是毫不知情者\" are false.\n Twenty-fourth, there is no need to check whether the propositions in A and C are contradictory because set A is empty.\n Twenty-fifth, assume the proposition B1:\"玛丽是凶手\" is false. Then the proposition B2:\"玛丽是同谋\" and B3:\"琳达是同谋\" are true.\n Twenty-sixth, check whether the propositions in B are contradictory. We can see that \'B2:\"玛丽是同谋\" is true.\' and \'B3:\"琳达是同谋\" is true.\' are contradictory. So the assumption of set B in the twenty-fifth step is invalid.\n Twenty-seventh, make new assumption for set B. Assume the proposition B2:\"玛丽是同谋\" is false. Then the proposition B1:\"玛丽是凶手\" and B3:\"琳达是同谋\" are true.\n Twenty-eighth, check whether the propositions in B are contradictory. There is no contradiction.\n Twenty-ninth, there is no need to check whether the propositions in A and B are contradictory because set A is empty.\n Thirtieth, check whether the propositions in B and C are contradictory. There is no contradiction.\n According to the above analysis, we can know that the assumption of the set B in the twenty-seventh step and the assumption of the set C in the twenty-third step both meet the requirements of the question and there is no contradiction between them. So that the true answer is C3:\"莉莉是毫不知情者\". "
